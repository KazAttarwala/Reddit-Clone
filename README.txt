# Reddit Client Application

## Overview
A modern Android application that demonstrates clean architecture, efficient network handling, and responsive UI patterns by interfacing with the Reddit API. This project showcases my proficiency in Android development including:

- MVVM architecture pattern
- Android Jetpack components
- REST API integration
- Reactive UI patterns
- Efficient data management

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Components
- **ViewModel**: Handles business logic and maintains UI state through configuration changes
- **LiveData**: Provides observable data objects that notify views when data changes
- **Repository**: Abstracts data sources and manages network requests
- **Navigation Component**: Handles fragment transactions and back stack management
- **RecyclerView with ListAdapter**: Efficiently displays dynamic lists with DiffUtil

### Network Layer
- **Retrofit**: Type-safe HTTP client for API communication
- **Glide**: Image loading library with caching and memory management
- **Coroutines**: Handles asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread

### Key Features

#### Content Display and Navigation
- Implements a responsive UI that adapts to different content types
- Uses fragment-based navigation with shared element transitions
- Efficiently loads and caches images with proper memory management
- Implements pull-to-refresh pattern with SwipeRefreshLayout

#### State Management
- Preserves UI state across configuration changes
- Implements proper loading states and error handling
- Uses pagination techniques to handle large datasets
- Maintains favorites state across different views

#### Search Implementation
- Real-time filtering with text highlighting
- Efficient text processing algorithms
- Non-destructive search pattern that preserves original dataset

## User Testing Guide

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (latest version)
- Android device or emulator running API level 21+
- Internet connection

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Run on a device or emulator

### Evaluating Technical Aspects
When evaluating this application, consider these technical aspects:

1. **Code Structure**:
   - Separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data)
   - Kotlin best practices and language features
   - Clean, readable code with appropriate documentation

2. **Performance**:
   - UI responsiveness under varying network conditions
   - Memory usage when scrolling through many images
   - Efficiency of the search implementation

3. **User Experience**:
   - Smooth transitions between screens
   - Appropriate loading states and error handling
   - Intuitive interaction patterns

4. **Architecture**:
   - MVVM implementation quality
   - Use of LiveData transformation
   - ViewModel and Repository separation

### Feature Walkthrough

To fully evaluate the application's capabilities:

1. **Browse Different Subreddits**:
   - Tap the subreddit name to access the subreddit selection
   - Note how the app efficiently loads new content

2. **Test Search Functionality**:
   - Use the search bar to filter content
   - Observe the real-time updates and highlighted matches

3. **Test Favorites System**:
   - Add several posts to favorites
   - Switch between subreddits, verify favorites persist
   - Remove items from favorites

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Scroll rapidly through image-heavy subreddits
   - Test responsiveness during network operations
   - Try operations during image loading

This project demonstrates my ability to build production-quality Android applications with modern architecture patterns and best practices.
